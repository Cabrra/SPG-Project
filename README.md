Ninja vs Zombies Game Project
=============================

## Overview

NinjaVsZombies was the first team project from the Game Development degree at Full Sail University which included two dedicated artists for the team. I was part of a team of 4 developers and we had 3 months to develop the game: from a paper model to a fully playable C++ game.

The paper model was designed brainstorming and testing the prototype with a focus group of testers following the industry standards. When a person was playing the game we never interacted with the subject; instead, we took notes of the how did the tester play. Finally, we as a team extracted the requirements for the game, created user stories and give estimations. This certainly was a great learning experience.

At the end of the 3 months period, we were able to deliver a fully functional game. We also learned how to interact with the artists and how the art pipeline works. Furthermore, due to some issues on estimations and scope, we learnt the proper way to pivot and re-organize the existing resources to gracefully handle the unexpected situations.

Other interesting elements:
	+ Testing Sessions
	+ Bug Bashing
	+ Documentation and task assignments
	+ Update other's code/bugs
	+ Post-mortem 
	+ Stand ups twice a day
	+ Feature refining
	+ Published to arcade machine (at Full Sail University)
	+ RTC requirement compliance
